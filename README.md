# Why does this exist?
Because as it turns out, Combining multiple programs into one is a good idea<br>
In other words, Reduce memory footprint because GTK consumes a lot of it<br>

# Future plans
Add exclusive features that don't really deserve to be their own projects into this<br>
Fun examples would be:<br>
* Wallpaper<br>
* Screenshot utility/overlay<br>
